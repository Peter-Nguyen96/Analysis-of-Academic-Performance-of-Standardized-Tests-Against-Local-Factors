An Analysis Academic Performance of Standardized Tests Against Local Factors

Overview:
An analysis was conducted on the standardized test scores of students across 15 schools.  The analysis factored in school population, funding, and the types of schools. The goal of this analysis was to identify trends in student funding and student standardized test scores in order to make funding decisions at the school and district level. This analysis will agregate data from a complete dataframe containing the students names, test scores, and information regarding the school they attended which include sizez, type, and level of funding.

Data Analysis Results:
The dataframes generated in this report differ from the data reported in the module.  Test scores of the 9th grade from Thomas High School were omitted for this analysis.

District Summary 
The District Summary dataframe remained largely unaffected, and only affected the data for Thomas High School.  Initially omitting the 9th grade data from Thomas High School dropped the average math score, average reading score and overall passing rate to around 60%.  However when normalized against and adjusted population accounting for the removal of 9th grade students, the average scores and passing rate were nearly the same, and changed by <1% in each category.
